Step-by-Step Guide to Load a Temporary Firefox Addon

    Open Firefox and navigate to about:debugging:
        Type about:debugging in the address bar and press Enter.

    Go to "This Firefox":
        On the left sidebar, click on "This Firefox".

    Click "Load Temporary Add-on...":
        You will see a button labeled "Load Temporary Add-on..." on the right side of the page. Click on it.

    Select the manifest.json file:
        A file dialog will open. Navigate to the folder where your addon files are located and select the manifest.json file.

Once you have selected the manifest.json file, your addon will be loaded temporarily. You should see it listed under "Temporary Extensions" on the about:debugging page. You can now test your addon by opening YouTube links to see if they are modified as expected.

You have to re-enable this every time you close Firefox. This is just a temporary addon.
